                I was born and raised in Dayton, OH. I graduated from Oakwood High School in 2018 with a 4.2 something GPA.
                I keep a somewhat active lifestyle playing pickup basketball with my friends and running on occasion. 
                In terms of sports, I probably spend more time watching them than playing them. Having lived in Ohio my 
                whole life, I am a huge Cincinnati fan, supporting the Reds and the Bengals as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers.
                So far this season (2021), I've been to around eight Reds games and I plan on attending at least one Bengals
                game to cheer on Joe Burrow and his teammates.

                I chose to attend the University of Cincinnati because of a few reasons. Before my first official college 
                tour here, a friend and I attended a FC Cincinnati soccer game at Nippert Stadium, right in the middle of campus.
                On our way in I was in love. I thought all the different buildings and dense campus was so cool. Then, I 
                learned about how all engineering majors participated in the co-op program. I was fascinated by the idea of 
                gaining work experience and making money to help pay for my tuition.

                Outside of sports, there's not much I love more than my cats. The long-haired, grey cat is named Bandit. 
                The other's name is Tiger (because of his stripes). My family adopted him after he visited my house about 
                every day for a year. While I don't live with them anymore, my little sister always sends me cute pictures and 
                funny videos of them.
