                        My name is Nicholas Jefferis. I am currently enrolled at the University of Cincinnati pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. 
                        My coding career began in the 7th grade when my math teacher introduced me to creating programs on my TI-84 calculator.

                        This is the first graphical game I created. Prior to this, I had created a text-based adventure game along with a few other projects, 
                        but unfortunately have lost all record of their source code. As you can probably tell from the footage, I created all the assets for 
                        this game. From this project, I learned about the basics of "animating" sprites, as well as concepts of hit boxes, collisions, and projectiles.
                        This was also my first exposure to the Python library "Pygame" which I would use for more small game projects in the future.

                        After making a few terrible side scrolling games, I decided I wanted to develop a rogue-like game featuring random world generation. 
                        Since I was doing this without researching how other people develop random world (like using perlin noise), I used a modified version of 
                        Conway's Game of Life to generate my worlds. I also developed my own assets for the game. This project was never completed but I learned
                         a lot while working on it.
