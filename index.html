              Since the 7th grade, I have been coding. It all started when my junior high math teacher introduced programs on our TI-84's. Immediately I was
          hooked. My first passion was creating programs to assist me with homework assignments; just simple formulas and equations. This evolved into animation and
          game creation. It wasn't until my freshman year of high school that I installed Python. My first projects were attempts at text-based dungeon games, which eventually
          evolved into some 2D games.

        Currently, I am enrolled in as a student at the University of Cincinnati, studying computer science. I have completed two co-op rotations so far. Both rotations 
        have been for Tenet3 Cybernetics where I work as a Software Developer in Test Intern. This summer I will be returning, where I hope to take on increased responsibility.
